On the heels of a recent travel advisory issued for Jamaica by the US State Department, Tourism Minister Edmond Bartlett is headed to the North American country to seek to assure travellers that the island is a "safe, secure and seamless" destination.

The tourism ministry in a release on Thursday advised that Bartlett and a team of senior tourism officials have departed Jamaica for the United States to engage with critical stakeholders ahead of what is expected to be the best summer tourist season for Jamaica.

“We're hitting the road to bolster arrivals from our biggest and best market, the United States. More than 74 per cent of our visitors come from the US and we don't take that for granted. We're determined to future-proof the sector this summer, and meeting with our American partners is crucial to realising that objective,” Bartlett stated.

The tourism minister pointed to the recent travel advisory and underscored that it is essential that American visitors are reminded of the “safe, secure and seamless” experience that a Jamaican vacation offers.

Bartlett also noted that it is prudent for Jamaica's presence to be felt in the American market at this time.
